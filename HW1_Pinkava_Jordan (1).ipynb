    "## Recommendations for the professor\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, there are three things the professor should do to improve his class (and his survey taking skills):\n",
    "1. Seeing that the percentage of scores that are above a 3.8 (which are considered \"good\" scores) is about 50%, that is telling that the professor has some work to do! With only half the class rating the professor's teaching as effective, that essentially means that half of the class is struggling with their teaching performance. In order to fix this, the professor should send the students another survey (with the correct range for scores) and ask them what they think are the most effective teaching styles for them to learn from. From there, the professor should analyze the scores to see which teaching styles will be most effective for the majority of the students in the class, and maybe see how to incorporate multiple effective teaching styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After cleaning up the data and taking out the scores that were either a 0 or a 6, there were 63 valid scores. This means that 29 students scores were not accounted for. Since nearly 30 student's perspectives were lost, the professor probably should have considered giving out an accurate survey, or adjusted the 0 and 6 scores to be included in the 1 and 5 score count (assuming that those who chose 6 were just choosing the highest score available, and the opposite for those who chose 0). Further, this may be telling on how the professor communicates with the students. If they told the students and wrote instructions that said they wanted scores between a 1 and 5, then they could have gotten a larger percentage of valid scores. In my opinion, the professor should have re-surveyed the students or had better communication/instructions on the survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since the mean and median fall on/around 3, it is telling that the professor's teaching effectiveness is only medicore. Like we saw, only about half the class gave them a good score, and their average score was below a 'good score'. Another recommendation to improve their ratings is to work on the course structure. The survey rates the students experience in BMGT404, so many students may be rating both the professor's teaching effectiveness and the way the course works. To improve the course overall, they should trial some other methods/formats for the class and ask their students which felt most effective/helpful. They can also do another survey for this concern, maybe to see if the bigger issue is their teaching style or the course's structure, and further assess from there. "
